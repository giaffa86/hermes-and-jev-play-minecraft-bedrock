# Log

Append-only record of wiki operations. Prefix: `## [YYYY-MM-DD] <type> | <title>`
where `<type>` is one of `ingest`, `query`, `lint`, `doc`.

## [2026-10-02] doc | LLM-wiki scaffolded and docs translated to English

- Restructured `docs/` into an LLM wiki (manifest `llm-wiki.md`, `index.md`,
  `log.md`, `sources.md`, `raw/`, `wiki/`).
- Translated `BEDROCK.md` (repo root) and `SURVIVAL-INTELLIGENCE.md`
  (now `docs/raw/SURVIVAL-INTELLIGENCE.md`) from Italian to English.
- Moved `REPRODUCTION-REPORT.md` and `evidence/` into `docs/raw/`; moved
  `HEADLESS-CLIENT.md` into `docs/wiki/headless-client.md`.
- Added synthesis pages: `wiki/overview.md`, `wiki/survival-intelligence.md`,
  `wiki/reproduction.md`, `wiki/open-questions.md`.

## [2026-10-02] doc | Human chat command channel roadmap

- Added `wiki/human-command.md`: roadmap for a human-in-chat natural-language
  command channel (`@bot seguimi`, `@bot aiutami coi mob`).
- Analyzed the current state: chat is already received (packet `text` id 9,
  fields `source_name`/`type`/`message`/`xuid`) but unused; player positions are
  tracked but gamertags are dropped; combat is ready; autonomous exploration is
  the hard gap.
- Defined milestones M1–M5 (capture/identify → follow → NL orders → guided
  mining → ack/exploration) and open questions (trigger syntax, follow
  semantics, plan-override priority, acknowledgement).
- Cross-linked from `index.md`, `overview.md` and `open-questions.md`.
